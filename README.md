# CustomGento_Cookiebot 🤝

This Magento 2 module integrates Cookiebot into your store. This is useful to give the customer the possibility to block
unwanted cookies and only allow wanted cookies. It requires an active Cookiebot subscription and can be completely
configured in your Cookiebot account.

## Installation

- `composer require customgento/module-cookiebot-m2`
- `bin/magento module:enable CustomGento_Cookiebot`
- `bin/magento setup:upgrade`
- `bin/magento setup:di:compile`
- `bin/magento cache:flush`

## Configuration

After installing the extension, just go to Stores > Configuration > Web > Cookiebot Settings to enable Cookiebot and
enter your Cookiebot ID. You find the ID in your Cookiebot account under Settings > Your scripts. All other
configuration regarding the cookie overlay is done in your Cookiebot account.

Please mind that this extension uses the manual cookie blocking mode. Hence, you still need to update all scripts, which
set not-strictly-necessary cookies in your system as described in
the [Cookiebot manual implementation guide](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/).

## Manual vs. Automatic Cookie Blocking

Unfortunately, Cookiebot currently does not support automatic blocking when RequireJS is used as stated in
their [docs](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015039559-Installing-Cookiebot-in-Magento-2-3-4). Since
Magento 2 does use RequireJS, we need to use the manual cookie blocking mode :-(

You need a [Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com/) account, so that this extension does anything useful for you.
